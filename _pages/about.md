Hi! I'm Zechen, a researcher in Computer Science at Brown University, working under the guidance of [Amy Greenwald](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/) and [Ronald Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/). My primary research interest are:

* understanding behavior, phenomena, and properties of fundamental Reinforcement Learning(RL) algorithms (e.g., Temporal Difference Learning(TD), Q-learning, Policy Gradient) and their derivatives or inspired variants (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN), implicit Q-learning) that demonstrate exceptional practical performance, aiming for mathematically provable insights beyond empirical observations and intuition.

* designing efficient RL algorithms capable of solving industrial or real-world problems

* understand the behavior and phenomena of fundamental RL algorithms when combined with neural networks (and other nonlinear function approximators)

* connecting reinforcement learning and continual learning
