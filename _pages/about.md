Hi! I'm Zechen, a PhD student in Computer Science at Duke University advised by [Ronald Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/). Previously, I was a research fellow in Computer Science at Brown University, working under the guidance of [Amy Greenwald](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/). Before that, I did my Master's degree in Computational Science at EPFL & USI in Switzerland, where I conducted research under the guidance of [Volkan Cevher](https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher?lang=en). Prior to graduate school, I worked as a quantitative trader.

## News
- **Nov 17th, 2025:** I will be presenting my NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight paper on **Thursday, Dec 4th** at **Poster #513** during **Poster Session 3** (11:00 AM – 2:00 PM, Exhibit Hall C/D/E) in San Diego.
  If you're attending NeurIPS, feel free to stop by and chat!  <u><a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/poster/115971">Full session details on my NeurIPS paper page</a></u>.


  Many thanks to the **NeurIPS Foundation** for the **NeurIPS 2025 Scholar Award**, which is supporting my travel to the conference.


- **Sept 18th, 2025:** My first-author paper, [_A Unifying View of Linear Function Approximation in Off-Policy RL Through Matrix Splitting and Preconditioning_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01774), was accepted to **NeurIPS 2025** as a <span style="color:red"> **_Spotlight_** </span> presentation (top 3% of submissions).


## Research Interests
Keywords: **Theoretical foundations of Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **deep RL**, **Continual learning**, **foundation model**, **LLMs**

I study the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning (RL) and sequential decision-making, aiming to develop a fundamental understanding of their mechanisms, bridge theory and practice, and design efficient algorithms that solve industrial problems. I am also interested in applying these insights to emerging domains such as the foundation model, with a focus on topics including reasoning, alignment, efficiency, and optimization.
