Hi! I'm Zechen, a PhD student in Computer Science at Duke University advised by [Ronald Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/). Previously, I was a research fellow in Computer Science at Brown University, working under the guidance of [Amy Greenwald](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/). Before that, I did my Master's degree in Computational Science at EPFL & University of Lugano (USI) in Switzerland, where I conducted research under the guidance of [Volkan Cevher](https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher?lang=en). Prior to graduate school, I worked as a quantitative trader.

## News
- **Sept 18th, 2025:** My NeurIPS 2025 submission, [_A Unifying View of Linear Function Approximation in Off-Policy RL Through Matrix Splitting and Preconditioning_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01774), was accepted as a <span style="color:red"> **_Spotlight_** </span> (top 3% of submissions).


## Research Interest

* understanding behavior, phenomena, and properties of fundamental Reinforcement Learning(RL) algorithms (e.g., Temporal Difference Learning(TD), Q-learning, Policy Gradient) and their derivatives or inspired variants (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN), implicit Q-learning) that demonstrate exceptional practical performance, aiming for mathematically provable insights beyond empirical observations and intuition.

* designing efficient RL algorithms capable of solving industrial or real-world problems

* understanding the behavior and phenomena of fundamental RL algorithms when combined with neural networks (and other nonlinear function approximators)

* connecting reinforcement learning and continual learning
