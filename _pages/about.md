Hi! I'm Zechen, a PhD student in Computer Science at Duke University advised by [Ronald Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/). Previously, I was a research fellow in Computer Science at Brown University, working under the guidance of [Amy Greenwald](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/). Before that, I did my Master's degree in Computational Science at EPFL & USI in Switzerland, where I conducted research under the guidance of [Volkan Cevher](https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher?lang=en). Prior to graduate school, I worked as a quantitative trader.
