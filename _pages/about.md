Hi! I'm Zechen, a PhD student in Computer Science at Duke University advised by [Ronald Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/). Previously, I was a research fellow in Computer Science at Brown University, working under the guidance of [Amy Greenwald](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/). Before that, I did my Master's degree in Computational Science at EPFL & USI in Switzerland, where I conducted research under the guidance of [Volkan Cevher](https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher?lang=en). Prior to graduate school, I worked as a quantitative trader.

## News
- **Sept 18th, 2025:** My NeurIPS 2025 submission, [_A Unifying View of Linear Function Approximation in Off-Policy RL Through Matrix Splitting and Preconditioning_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01774), was accepted as a <span style="color:red"> **_Spotlight_** </span> (top 3% of submissions).


## Research Interest

* Theoretical foundations of Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially for deep RL

* Theory of neural networks and transformers

* Continual learning and lifelong adaptation
